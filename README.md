Sourcing information from Tab-Separated Values files, it systematically organizes data concerning students and their credit hours, GPA, and Ids. From there, the program categorizes the students into different sections such as freshman, sophomore, honor roll etc. This was made possible by utilizing a dictionary or a plethora of linked lists.
